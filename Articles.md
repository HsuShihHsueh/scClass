# scClass: A immune cell classifier tool create by supervised deep learning

## Abstract
Single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) is a novel RNA seqensing method which can track their RNA-expression in every single cell. 
However, the traditional way to annotate cell-type like isolate by flow cytometry or clustering by seurat is either expensive or inefficient.
Here we present scClass, a supervised deep learning model for annotating celltype on immmune cell.
scClass use bone marrow and cord blood dataset to training and try to predict on pbmc and other dataset.
We provide a package for running scClass on Python and have a demo on Colab at .....
